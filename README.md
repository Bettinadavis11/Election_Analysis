## Overview of Election audit:
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. The data provided was quite extensive and it consisted in ballot IDs, name of the voting counties, and the candidates names.

## Election-Audit Summary
This code can be used in any other election, in any state, or even in any country of the world.
If the source data also included the voters race, this would help future candidates targeting their desired demographics.
if for example, our source data included how people from different ethnicities favored each candidate, campaign managers could allocate their campaign budget more wisely.

Another example would be to add voters age in our data source, as most young people do not really participate in elections, campaign funds could be used targeting the population demographic that they would expect more results from.
